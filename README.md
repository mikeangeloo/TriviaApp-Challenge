# Project Details

- Project Name: Triva App
- Framework: React Native

#### Description:

Trivia App is a mobile application developed with React Native that allows users to play a trivia game. It uses the Open Trivia Database public API to offer questions of various categories and difficulty levels. Users can answer multiple choice questions and receive instant feedback on whether their answers are correct or incorrect. At the end, the score obtained is displayed. The app is designed to provide a simple and fun experience on iOS and Android devices.

#### Dependencies

1. **@react-native-picker/picker**:
   A picker component for React Native that allows you to create selection dropdown menus.

2. **@react-navigation/native**:
   Library for navigation in React Native applications, providing navigation between screens and route management.

3. **@react-navigation/native-stack**:
   React Navigation plugin to use high-performance navigation stacks with native animations.

4. **he (HTML Entities)**:
   A small library for encoding and decoding HTML entities.

5. **react-hook-form**:
   Library to manage forms in React and React Native efficiently and with minimal code.

6. **react-native-screens**:
   Optimizes navigation in React Native by enabling native screen management, improving performance.

7. **zustand**:
   A lightweight and flexible solution for state management in React applications, with a simple and efficient API.
8. **API Trivia**:
   Public API to obtain information from the Open Trivia Database.

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
